> In this paper we apply a game-theoretic approach with the aim of finding an efficient parcel collection strategy with multiple drones. We implemented an algorithm that simulates a Multistage Game where each player represents a drone, whose trajectory in the space is defined during the sequential moves. The decision is taken according to a game-theoretic approach, considering the positions of the remaining parcels and of the other players.
